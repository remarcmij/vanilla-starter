# Motivation for creating this Starter Repo

- This starter repo was created specifically for students of the HackYourFuture organization who have just completed or are about to complete the JavaScript curriculum modules. At this point, students should be able to create a Single Page Application but are still some weeks away from learning React. If they want to start working on personal projects, vanilla JavaScript is all they have in their toolkit to prototype their ideas in the interim.

- At the end of the JavaScript modules students will have learned the essentials of the JavaScript language, manipulation the DOM, and how to fetch data from web APIs. However, students still need to learn more about application design, best practices and patterns. This is also where this starter repo tries to fill a gap by providing an example where these principles are applied to good use.

- This repo also give students an early exposure to concepts that they will learn later in depth in the React module, such as client-side routing and state management. It should give them some insights into how these concepts could potentially be implemented by libraries such as React, when they have come to that stage in the HackYourFuture curriculum.
